I found this post about an individual doing exactly what I am attempting to do, and will be using what they did as a framework for how I will proceed through my project. I plan to reuse minimal code from their version of the project, but I will likely use their code (either directly or as a reference) for Discord and LLM APIs so that I don't need to worry about learning said APIs. I will credit sources as they are used in my code.


TODO LIST:

x Create a github repo for this project.

- Write a Python script to extract discord messages from the API and store them in a csv file. Discord Dumper should be a good framework to build off so I don't need to learn the API.

- Include a failsafe such that if a message ID already exists in the dataset, cease scraping. (This will give me the ability to run the script later to add more to the dataset.

- Run said script overnight to gather the initial dataset.

- Create a local MySQL database (or install SQLite) and load the csv file into the database.

- Clean dataset (replace mentions & real names, etc)

- Parse dataset from individual messages into conversations (possibly include LDA at this part).

- Using each conversation, create a prompt/input/response with the response being based on each of my existing messages. The collection of these prompt/input/repsonses will be the dataset with which we train the LLM.

- Install a Python package I can use to train an existing LLM.

- Hook up training data to LLM via Python script, train it for a few days and monitor progress. (Learning a LLM API will probably take a while, but I need to learn it with enough time remaining in order to have time to train).

- This should take a few weeks to finish training if all goes well.

- (Optional) Learn how to make a discord bot while training is happening, then create a bot and stick the AI into it so that I can add it to the discord server I am using to train it and show it to friends.
