# __**KCBot**__
Kaycee is an AI language model trained on my Discord message history, allowing it to respond to messages as I would. Included in this repo are all files written and used for this project, but the data I scraped and the AI data post-training have been excluded for privacy reasons. This repo can be used to create another Kaycee bot trained off of someone else's Discord message history.

All parties in the server from which the message history data have given consent for me to use said data for this project, and will be asked again if I decide to update Kaycee with newer data.
